MakeUserInstruction

Creates a UserInstruction

Do nothing with the block of commands, pass string directly to the UserInstruction
Store the custom UserInstruction object


UserInstruction

Take the arguments passed in and populates the local variable map (also check for duplicate variable names?)
Calls on parser, passing the block of commands along with the local variable map
	Gets back a ListNode
Execute ListNode


Calling on UserInstruction

Take the instance of the specific UserInstrucion and call instance.clone(instance, args)
	clone(UserInstruction, ) will return a copy of itself with the new arguments
Call on newInstance.getValue()


Parser

Normally would look through global variables if a variable is encountered during parsing
	If a local variable map is also passed in, look through both maps (we need to determine how to handle duplicate variable names)
