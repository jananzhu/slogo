A development environment that helps users write SLogo programs.

##### Sprint 1 Status
We have successfully implemented front end & back end APIs. The demo branch has the most recent version with all turtle commands working from pseudo-command line while the master branch has all of the features we implemented for this sprint (the backward command does not work due to some refactoring in the backend but is supported by the front end as seen in the demo branch).

##### To-Do's
* incorporate error throwing 
* incorporate multiple turtles
* incorporate conditionals
* incorporate patterns/curves
